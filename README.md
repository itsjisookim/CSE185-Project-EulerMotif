# EulerMotif
(Work in Progress)
This is our final profect for UCSD [CSE185 : Advanced Bioinformatics Lab](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#:~:text=CSE%20185.%20Advanced%20Bioinformatics%20Laboratory%20(4)). EulerMotif is a known motif enrichement visualization tool where is shows the relationships of overlapping motif enrichment across multiple samples. This version only allows chromosome specific DNA motif analysis with [HOMER](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/motif/) known motif library and ChIP-seq sample peak files generated through HOMER.
